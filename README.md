# TOS Simulator

> edit version: godot 3.5

## Description

A pratice to be familiar with Godot.
The basic concept is to used RayCast detecting if there were at least three gems in a line, but I use Raycast with BFS instead.
The Raycast in Godot doesn't like in Unity, it can only return the first collider when casting.

And it's all I can do in this project, I might not update in future.
